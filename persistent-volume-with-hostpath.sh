# Mastering Kubernetes One Task at a Time - Persistent Storage Volumes with 'hostPath'

# 
# Author's NOTE
# 1. This file although can run as one whole script, some commands may error because of need for occassional manual edits. 
# 2. Make the right call after reviewing and following command specific instructions below.
# 3. Normally the commands are used to create one resource object at a time for the primary purpose of learning.

#
#  OBJECTIVE 1 - CREATE PERSISTENT VOLUMES USING LOCAL DISK OF WORKER NODES
# - Create a deployment with each pod reading and writing to its own host node's local disk
# - If pod is deleted, deployment will create new pods to match replica count and 
#   new pods will have access to prior content because data persists beyond the lifetime of a pod
#

# Create deployment manifest
